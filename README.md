# Resume
A repo that hosts my resume and builds it using GitHub Actions.

## Files:

**resume.cls** - holds commands and configurations for resume formating (e.g. sections, subsections, titles). \
**.github/workflows** - contains the GitHub Actions yaml file that builds the rendered pdf version 
> The rendered resume can be viewed in Releases page.
