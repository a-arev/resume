# Resume
A repo that hosts my resume and builds it using GitHub Actions.

## Files:
**resume.tex** - holds the inputs for each section and subsections (e.g. work history info, school info, skills & interests). \
**resume.cls** - holds commands and configurations for resume formating (e.g. sections, subsections, titles).
